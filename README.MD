## Usage

Install from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rawg-library-cleaner/hhjibfjhfjoledimkkafjammfkoekhmi) and enjoy! Yay!

## Motivation

RAWG is great, but I'm too lazy to click every game and select it's status there, so I created this extention which lets you use your keyboard to quickly sort through all of your owned and unsorted games.
